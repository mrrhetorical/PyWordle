## PyWordle

### What is this?
A command-line wordle written in Python.

### Why is this?
I had time between classes with nothing at all to do and we're using Python for CSC 135.

### Usage
Run with Python 3+ using `py wordle.py`. Probably doesn't need to be Python 3 even but I'm not gonna bother testing. I made this using Python 3.12.5.

#### Notes/Attribution
This uses the `english.txt` file found on most unix operating systems. I will maybe find out what dictionary wordle actually uses to make it better because there are sometimes some really weird hard words.
